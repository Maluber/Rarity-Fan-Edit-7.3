Replace locales.lua and options_defaults.lua with the ones in the Rarity folder. 
Please make sure to back-up both the originals before replacing just in case you get any errors.
It has been tested and no problems so far. 

Locale is fine with English but may cause problems if using a different language.
This is becuase I only added names to locale file and am unsure if more needs to be done with it.

Everything Argus related is trackable. You will need to make each of the 3 'Fel-Spotted Egg' repeatable as its not on by default. 
There are 3 versions of this to track each rare.

Any problems please let me know.
